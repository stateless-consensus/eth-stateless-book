The future of Ethereum stateless is currently in active development, including research, protocol development, and UX impact.

## Stateless community

A diverse set of people and teams are working on all these fronts, including:

- Teams from the Ethereum Foundation led by [Stateless Consensus](https://x.com/StatelessEth) and supported by teams such as the Applied Research Group, [Robust Incentives Group](https://ethereum.github.io/rig/), STEEL, [Devops](https://ethpandaops.io/), and [Cryptography](https://crypto.ethereum.org/team).
- Multiple core developers from EL clients such as [Nethermind](https://www.nethermind.io/), [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/), [EthereumJS](https://ethereumjs.github.io/), and [Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/).
- Many independent contributors from the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Ethereum Fellowship Program (EFP)

Stateless Ethereum has also been part of multiple past [EFP](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/) projects:

- Cohort three (late-2022):
  - [Verkle Tries migration exploration](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-three/blob/master/projects/verkle-trie-migration-exploration.md)
- Cohort four (mid-2023):
  - [Post-Verkle State Expiry](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-four/blob/master/projects/post-verkle-state-expiry.md)
  - [Verkle Tree Library in Nim](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-four/blob/master/projects/verkle-tree-nim.md)
  - [Verkle Tries in-circuit](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-four/blob/master/projects/verkle-tries-in-circuit.md)
- Cohort five (mid-2024):
  - [Reth Verkle PoC](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-five/blob/main/projects/reth-verkle-poc.md)

## Grants

Moreover, the following are ongoing grants actively working on many fronts:

- Stateless expiry ([EIP-7736](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7736)) PoC using Verkle Trees
- Zig EVM implementation to be used in a future stateless [Zig client](https://github.com/jsign/phant).

If youâ€™re interested in working on any specific stateless topic and need a grant, please send your proposal to [stateless@ethereum.org](mailto:stateless@ethereum.org) for consideration!
