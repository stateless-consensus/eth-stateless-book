# SIC calls

The *Stateless Consensus* team hosts the *Stateless Implementers Calls,* which run bi-weekly.

## Schedule and agenda

Scheduled calls and their corresponding agendas are in the github [ethereum/pm repository](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20Stateless%20Implementers%20Call). In these calls, we share and discuss any progress made on stateless Ethereum efforts.

The calls are open, so anyone is welcome to join!
